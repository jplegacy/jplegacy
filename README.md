## Hey there! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a student at [Union College](https://www.union.edu/) with a knack for coding and a love for all things tech. My toolkit includes languages like **Python**, **C++**, **Go(lang)**, and **Java**, and I'm not shy about diving into the complexities of **Computer Organization**, **Natural Language Processing**, and **Artificial Intelligence**.

### Skills:

- **Languages:** Python, C++, Go(lang), Java
- **Specialties:** Computer Organization, NLP, AI
- **Projects:** Optimizing matrix multiplication with Cohn-Umans' framework
- **Experience:** Cloud app development, Agile methodologies

Certified in **HTML5 Application Development**, I enjoy the thrill of exploring computational objects and diving into sentiment analysis using FinBERT models. Excited about the ever-evolving tech landscape, I'm always ready to learn and contribute to exciting projects!

Let's code something amazing! ðŸš€
